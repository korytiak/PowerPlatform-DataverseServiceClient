1.0.23:
Added Async version of ExecuteOrganizationRequest to allow for requests to be made bounded with a custom logging message.
Update Default settings for "UseWebAPI" in preparation for future work. 
    Note: for Create or Update operations that make extensive use of related entities you may need to reconfigure UseWebAPI to "true". 

1.0.9:
Fixed an issue with Custom User Agent headers incorrectly causing a format error when .net core is used. Proper User-Agent format must be used to send requests including the user agent.

Fix formatting issue with RequestId and Session Id.
Fix exponential back off issue for WebAPI based calls when retrying based on a throttled connection.
Added implementation for Connection and Configuration constructor. 
    - Allows for a instance of the service client to be created and configured without initialization the client.  The client can then be initialized later using the .Connect() method.
    - This constructor accepts 3 parameters
        - connectionOptions (ConnectionOptions) = Options necessary to create the connection.
        - deferConnection (bool) defaulted to false = When set to true, will configure but not create the connection until .Connect() is called. 
        - serviceClientConfiguration (ConfigurationOptions) defaulted to null = When populated, pre-configures the connection configuration. 
    - If deferred connection is set to true, .Connect() must be called before the client is useable. 
Added Connect() method for use with the deferred behavior of the Connection and Configuration Constructor.
Activated support for adding additional headers to request when using the Configuration Constructor. 
    Note: Dataverse will only allow specific headers to be used. Use of this capability requires foreknowledge of this capability and agreement with Power Platform Dataverse team.

0.6.6:

0.6.1:
Minor Bump to 0.6.x - *Should* be last bump prior to 1.0. 

Added initial support for AD auth for OnPremise.  This will work for full framework only. 
Added new constructor that will accept a ConnectionOptions class and a ConfigurationOptions Options Object.  This constructor is currently not fully implemented. 
    This is prep work for a builder process and intended to unify the connection flow to a single constructor at some point in the future. 
    The goal of this work will be to resolve the issues caused by lazy loading hosts. 
Fixed a bug in Logger when working with Connection Strings where log events would not be correctly generated. 
Speculative fix for GIT issue #219 and #220
Fixed a bug where LastError was not properly reset, fixed Git #229

    New AppSetting is called "MaxBufferPoolSizeOveride" - there is currently not a way to set this via code at runtime. 
    Support for configuration of this will be added as part of the new Constructor for .net core, .net framework can use it by setting the appsetting value now.
Fixed exceptions not being thrown from several paths during login flows. 

-- WARNING -- 
.net 3.0 Target Removed from Nuget packages. 
REFACTORED helpers and utilities for the DataverseServiceClient into the Microsoft.PowerPlatform.Dataverse.Client.Extensions Namespace of the DataverseClient.
Dependency changes:
    Removed Microsoft.Dynamics.Messages.Sdk.nuspec for Dynamics messages at this time.  This will return in the future in some form. 
    Removed Microsoft.Cds.Sdk.Proxy.dll from Package and replaced with Microsoft.Crm.Sdk.Proxy.dll in package. 
    System.Text.Json moved to 6.0.2 min dependency.
        -- Note: As of this writing, when using Azure functions you cannot use Microsoft.Net.Sdk.Functions.3.0.12 or .3.0.13 due to blocks on System.Text.Json dependencies.  You need to either use .3.0.11 or move up to 4.x 
    System.ServiceModel.Http moved to 4.9.0 due to internal dependencies on Microsoft.Xrm.Sdk


0.5.17:
 Accepted fix requested here: https://github.com/microsoft/PowerPlatform-DataverseServiceClient/issues/205
  fixing delete by alternate key request in client. 
 Fixed dependency issue for System.Security.Permissions  (git #203)  
 Refactored AuthorityResolver to discover AAD authentication authorities to allow for direct access by other clients. 


0.5.10:
Added new property "RecommendedDegreesOfParallelism". 
    This property will report the recommended number of threads for communicating with Dataverse.

Fixed an issue with updating ManyToOneRelationship based attributes.
Fixed an issue with activity parties relationships.

0.5.7:
Removed Sealed attribute from the Service Client Class. 
Fixed an issue with null values being sent to the API causing a null exception to be raised. 
Fixed missing nuget dependency for Microsoft.Identity.Client.Extensions.Msal, Nuget now properly includes that package. 

0.5.5: 
Fixed a nuget dependency issue for Microsoft.Extensions.Caching.Memory
    Microsoft.Extensions.Caching.Memory, min version 3.1.8

0.5.4:
Fixed and issue with the client being non-castable to IOrganizationServiceAsync, Client will now cast again. (Internal Report)
    Special note: 
        IOrganizationServiceAsync has async methods without cancellation support. this is required for service mapping as the dataverse server does not natively support this feature. 
        IOrganizationServiceAsync2 has async methods WITH cancellation support.  
        This surfaces in the client as 2 forms of each async method and is currently necessary to support internal auto generation of contracts for service communication. We will work to improve this in the future.
        Cancellation events will currently raise an OperationCancelled Exception, this can either be the topmost exception, or embedded in a DataverseException.
        Cancellation methods are 'preferred' if you need to support cancellation in your application.
Fixed an issue with External authentication type not being properly passed though to cloned clients.  (git #162)

0.5.2:

Fixed a bug where a WebAPI navigation property did not match with its metadata descriptor.
Fixed Retry delay issue when making calls to the CDS WebAPI – thanks to GIT user stvonolf for the catch of this issue.
Added new Exception, CdsClientOperationException - this will be used when an exception is raised via the CDSClient when CDSClient is using WebAPI.
Added IntelliSense Doc Support
Added support for bypassing custom Plug-in Execution during SDK Operation.
    This is a special use capability that requires a specialized permission in the CDS infrastructure to use.
    Currently this is only permitted for use by users that have the System Administrator Security Role.

0.2.16-Alpha:
Fixed issue when CUD via WebAPI when entity contains a entity reference that is a polymorphic reference. ( IE customer data type )

 Rerouted CdsServiceClient Helpers to use WebAPI path for CUD requests.

0.2.2-Alpha:
Several updates to Create / Update / Delete operations to move the underlying features over to use the WebAPI.

0.2.1-Alpha:
BREAKING CHANGE!!!
Altering Nuget Version to 3 digit semantic version
Namespace change from Microsoft.Powerplatform.xxxx to Microsoft.PowerPlatform.xxxx

    This user provided function takes the form of string FunctionName (string InstanceUri),  When called, the current instance URI will be
    passed in and the function is expected to return an access token for access to that instance.
    This form allows an given instance of the CdsServiceClient to be associated with a Auth Processor vs having the auth processor at the process level.

Fixed a bug reported in .clone in .net core builds.  When cloning a connection in .net core, the system would think you were using an invalid auth type.

Known issues:
    None at this time.. Please report any issues on the GitHub Issues site.


0.0.1.7-Alpha
    Fixed a Nuget Package dependency issue in Microsoft.Dynamics.Sdk.Messages

0.0.1.6-Alpha
Intial Alpha release of Microsoft.Cds.Client.CdsServiceClient
    WARNING: This is an ALPHA release.
    This library is a rename and renamespace of the Microsoft.Xrm.Tooling.Connector.CrmSeriviceClient.
    If you are familiar with the CrmServiceClient,  By Renaming each occurrence of Crm to Cds, you should find that API's match up.
    Major changes from CrmServiceClient:
        This library does not support User Interactive or User Password Auth flows in .net core.
        This library does not support AD or ADFS login to OnPremise,
            to use against an onPrem instance of CDS, your instance must be configured with
            ADFS + OAuth and the application ID you wish to use registered.
        This library removes several Dynamics specific helper methods from CrmServiceClient.
            this additional methods can be found by include the nuget package Microsoft.Cds.Client.Dynamics
